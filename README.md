# Color-Guess-Game

The aim of this small web app is to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS and javascript as well as DOM manipulations.

## Idea of the app

The app is a color guessing game, in which you try to match one of the 6 genertaed colored squares to the RGB values mentioned in the head. you can click any of the colored square. If your guess is not correct, the square you clicked will fade and a word will be generated telling you to 'try again'. But if your guess is correct, all squares will change its color to the clicked one as well as the heading background, also 'Correct' word will show up.
